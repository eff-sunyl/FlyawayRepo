Phase 2 project.
Name : Flyaway

Follow instructions on steps-to-build.txt.

Note: MySql running on local machine is exposed to internet. Once you build your war using the build steps, you can deploy the app in your webserver and the application should be functional.

Pl reach out to me on ratboddu@gmail.com or contact me on phone.

I have also deployed this app in my lab instance -
http://localhost:7070/Flyaway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
